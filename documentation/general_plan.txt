Make an object oriented chess game.
Have two separate systems.
- a backend that manages all the chess logic
- a frontend that provides either a gui or cli 
- - they shouldn't need to access internals of chess logic. just be able to make calls to very surface level functions

Focus on creating the chess logic. Implement cli side of things when trying to test each feature of the logic.
e.g. create logic for board initialisation then create logic to display the board to test the new feature.

The GUI and CLI should only call chess logic functions and pass in move inputs.
Game variables such as the current player's turn or the available pieces should be treated as read only for the GUI and CLI code.
Only chess logic functions will be allowed to alter game variables.


Programming the turns:
- do basic movement first
- - make movement work on an empty board
- - make movement check for pieces in the way
- - make checks for discovered checks and prevent them.
