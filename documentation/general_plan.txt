Make an object oriented chess game.
Have two separate systems.
- a backend that manages all the chess logic
- a frontend that provides either a gui or cli 
- - they shouldn't need to access internals of chess logic. just be able to make calls to very surface level functions

Focus on creating the chess logic. Implement cli side of things when trying to test each feature of the logic.
e.g. create logic for board initialisation then create logic to display the board to test the new feature.
